TutorialTitle=Using the Menu
TutorialBody=Use &DOWNLEFT; and &DOWNRIGHT; to scroll through songs.\nWhen you find a song you want to play, select it with &CENTER;, then pick a difficulty.\nIf you change your mind, use &UPLEFT; or &UPRIGHT;to back out and pick another song.

HowToPlayTitle1=The Basics
HowToPlayTitle2=Freeze!
HowToPlayTitle3=Be Careful

HowToPlayBody1=The main objective is to step on the arrows to the rhythm of the song.\n\nWhen the moving arrows overlap with the grey arrow targets on top of the screen, step on them!
HowToPlayBody2=If a long arrow is coming up, step and hold it down until the end of it!\n\nDon't let go of it, as you will get misses on every song beat!
HowToPlayBody3=If arrows go past the grey arrow targets, your life meter will deplete and your score will decrease.\n\nThis is especially important for long arrows, as they can give many misses quickly!
